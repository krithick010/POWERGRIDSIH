# 🚀 NETLIFY DROP - QUICK START GUIDE

## ✅ Your project is ready for Netlify deployment!

The `out` folder has been generated and contains all static files.

---

## 📦 What to Deploy

Deploy the **`out`** folder located at:
```
/Users/vmeenakshisundaram/POWERGRIDSIH/POWERGRIDSIH/out
```

---

## 🎯 Deployment Steps (3 minutes)

### Step 1: Go to Netlify Drop
Open your browser and visit:
**https://app.netlify.com/drop**

### Step 2: Drag and Drop
1. Open Finder and navigate to your project folder
2. Locate the `out` folder
3. **Drag the entire `out` folder** onto the Netlify Drop page
4. Wait for upload to complete (usually 10-30 seconds)

### Step 3: Get Your URL
- Netlify will provide a random URL like: `random-name-123.netlify.app`
- Your frontend is now live! 🎉

## ⚙️ After Deployment

### Configure Backend URL

Your frontend needs to connect to a backend. You have 3 options:

#### Option A: Deploy Backend Separately (Recommended)

**Using Render.com (Free):**
1. Go to https://render.com
2. Create account / Sign in
3. Click "New +" → "Web Service"
4. Connect your GitHub repository
5. Configure:
   - **Name:** `powergrid-backend`
   - **Root Directory:** `backend`
   - **Environment:** `Python 3`
   - **Build Command:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - **Start Command:** `uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`
6. Add Environment Variables:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
   SMTP_USER=krithickrobotics7@gmail.com
   SMTP_PASSWORD=your_app_password
   TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_sid
   TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_token
   TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=+15855802717
   ENVIRONMENT=production
   ```
7. Click "Create Web Service"
8. Wait for deployment (5-10 minutes)
9. Copy your backend URL (e.g., `https://powergrid-backend.onrender.com`)

**Update Netlify:**
1. Go to your Netlify dashboard
2. Select your site
3. Go to **Site Settings → Environment Variables**
4. Add:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL = https://your-backend-url.onrender.com
   ```
5. Go to **Deploys** and click "Trigger deploy"

#### Option B: Use Railway.app

Similar process to Render, but with Railway:
1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Deploy backend with one click
3. Get backend URL
4. Update `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` in Netlify

#### Option C: Local Backend (Testing Only)

Use ngrok to expose your local backend:
```bash
# In one terminal - start backend
cd backend
python3.12 -m uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000

# In another terminal - expose with ngrok
ngrok http 8000
```

Copy the ngrok URL and update Netlify's `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`.

---

## 🧪 Test Your Deployment

1. Open your Netlify URL
2. Try to sign in with an email
3. If backend is not configured, you'll see connection errors (this is expected)
4. Once backend is deployed and configured, everything should work!

---

## 📋 Pre-Deployment Checklist

✅ Build completed successfully  
✅ `out` folder exists  
✅ Static files generated  
✅ Images optimized  
✅ `netlify.toml` configured  

**Next Steps:**
- [ ] Deploy `out` folder to Netlify Drop
- [ ] Deploy backend to Render/Railway
- [ ] Configure environment variables
- [ ] Test the live application

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "API connection failed"
- Backend is not deployed yet
- Wrong `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` in Netlify environment variables
- CORS not configured on backend

### "Build failed locally"
Run: `npm run build` and check for errors

### "Images not loading"
- Make sure `images: { unoptimized: true }` is in `next.config.mjs` ✅ (already configured)

### "404 on page refresh"
- Make sure `netlify.toml` has the SPA fallback redirect ✅ (already configured)
